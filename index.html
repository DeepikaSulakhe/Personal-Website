                            The backend, developed in Java using the Spring Boot framework for REST API functionality, the frontend, implemented in ReactJS
                            for the GUI client-server model.The application's data management was achieved through MySQL Workbench.</p>

                        <p>This a Machine Learning which i did as a part of my course work. I have worked on ML Models that take normal images as main data, Did data augmentation(331 images) like shrpening, adding contrast and so on, followed data Pre-processing to 2308 images. Next step feature exxtraction with two
                            methods used that are using HOG Feature extarction(Histogram Oriented Gradient) another is PCA-LDA Feature extraction. For training we used SVM, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour,Logistic resgression on both feature extraction techniques.Finally ensembled all the models accuracy for the best accuracy.
                            For this project we scored a A grade.

                            The distributed system was simulated using Python3 multithreading, which used a fork-join model to distribute frames and collected the
                            final frames to generate a video with mesh overlayed on top of human face.</p>

                            The backend is comprised of three services (restaurant-service, ordering-service, and delivery service) which are connected through
                            Microservices(Kafka) and Zuul proxy is used to provide dynamic routing of incoming API requests to their respective service.
                            All the microservices are registered through Eureka Server configuring ports and service URLs.
